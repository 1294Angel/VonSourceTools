StudioMDL Placement Instructions
=================================

To use the bundled StudioMDL feature, copy the following files from your
Source SDK installation into this folder:

Required:
- studiomdl.exe

Typical Source SDK locations:
- Half-Life 2: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\bin\
- Team Fortress 2: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\bin\
- Garry's Mod: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\bin\
- Counter-Strike: Source: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\bin\

Note: StudioMDL also requires the game's VProject to be set correctly.
You may also need to copy additional DLLs depending on your game version.

If you prefer, you can also:
1. Set the path in data/paths.py (STUDIOMDL_PATH variable)
2. Or specify the path in the Blender UI under QC Generator > Advanced Settings
