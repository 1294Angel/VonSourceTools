This is a file of backup credits incase the addon is distributed outside of the github so people can get proper credit for their great work!
This addon is a mixture of my own work (Vona, https://github.com/1294Angel/VonSourceTools) and the people or addons underneath (Will use the addon name if I am unable to find the individual creator of each addon, and will provide links to git and official downloads for each addon I have borrowed code or systems from, as well as seperating those I have used for inspiration from those that I have use snippets or sections of code from!)


Dependancies - (Addons whos features are relied upon by certain systems but whos code is not taken out of their addons and placed within my own):
1. Blender Source Tools : Unknown Name: Used for export to SMD, required dependancy : https://github.com/Artfunkel/BlenderSourceTools | https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Blender_Source_Tools | http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/

Code Sections/Features - (Addons where code has been taken from and used, anything from small snippets or large sections/entire features.)
